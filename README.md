# The-adventure-of-Lunk
A 2D mini RPG in which the player controls his hero in a 2D map, collecting and wearing different items and fighting monsters.
The game will most probably have some GUI or maybe a console text UI, or maybe both(in which case it will offer the player a choice). It will most probably have a save/load game feature, the monsters are probably going to have some sort of a primitive
AI(enabling them to circle around the map like morons and to attack the player on sight).
Level data will be stored in .txt files which describe the map(in ASCII symbols), the items' and the monsters' stats.
