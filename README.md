# The-adventure-of-Lunk
A 2D mini RPG in which the player controls his hero in a 2D map, collecting and wearing different items and fighting monsters.
The game will most probably have some GUI or maybe a console text UI, or maybe both(in which case it will offer the player a choice). It will most probably have a save/load game feature, the monsters are probably going to have some sort of a primitive
AI(enabling them to circle around the map like morons and to attack the player on sight).
Level data will be stored in .txt files with a similar content as the one below:
